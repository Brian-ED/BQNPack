A very very very simple """package manager""". Just for importing stuff from anywhere in the system easily.
The location of this folder is kind of important, because all imports in "dict.bqn" will be relative to this one. Other than that, you can place it wherever you'd like.

Do note, this """package manager""" is not a serious attempt at a good package manager.
